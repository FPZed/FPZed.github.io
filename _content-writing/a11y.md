# Purpose
This is a guide for content writers on our team to write more accessible content for our products. We'll go over best practices and user needs, and learn how developers, designers, and end-users interact with accessible content and technology.

## What is web accessibility?
Web accessibility is the practice of designing user experiences that accommodate people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, cognitive or motor disabilities. This is accomplished through thoughtful design and assistive technology.

The goal of an accessible website is for disabled users to gain the same value from the website as abled users do.

A writer is just one part of the great labour delivering content to users. Your content needs to work with both developer tools and user interactions.

## Why make things accessible?
### Good user experience
Good design and web accessibility go hand in hand. Websites that are accessible are easier and more satisfying to use for all users.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0px">Accessibility also helps people without disabilities:</p>
* Older people with changing abilities due to aging.
* People with slow internet connections or limited bandwidth.
* People with temporary or situational disabilities. For example, someone with a broken arm, or someone in a library where they can’t play audio.

### Legal mandate
Many countries have passed laws or regulations that require public and private organizations to make their public-facing web content accessible. In the United States, it is illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities, and neglecting accessibility could lead to a lawsuit.

In Ontario, it will be legally required that private companies follow international web accessibility standards by 2021.


# User Needs
Users visit your website with a goal in mind. A disabled user must have their needs accommodated if they are to accomplish their goal. First, we must understand how a disabled user can and cannot interface with our content.




# Assistive Technology
Assistive technology is a key component to delivering accessibility to users. Assistive technology allows users to interface with the web. The web, in turn, must be designed to interface with assistive technology.

As content creators, we should understand the ways users can interact with our content.

## Screen reader
Screen readers are used by people with visual disabilities to interact with web content.

Screen readers are software that use text-to-speech technology to scan computer applications, such as an Internet browser, and read out content as the user navigates the application.

With their keyboard, the user can focus on elements of a web page, such as a page title, a menu, buttons, text or images. These are read out or described by the screen reader.

### How screen readers work
For a web page to successfully interact with screen readers, it needs to be designed so that users can navigate in a logical, linear way. A web page must be developed so that screen readers can accurately describe the elements inside the web page.

### Semantic structure
Developers use HTML to build websites. They do this by structuring the website with elements such as Header, Nav, Main or Footer, and images, links and paragraphs.
When a screen reader scans a website, it is reading this HTML structure and the content within. A website’s HTML should be well structured and semantic so it can be easily and logically read.
See: “headers and titles” on page 27
Further, the HTML should be structured so that the web page can be navigated entirely by keyboard.
Developers are able to integrate accessibility copy into these HTML elements.

### Alternative text
When a screen reader focuses on not-text content such as an image, it should read a description that conveys either the content or function of the non-text content.

To accomplish this, developers must supply alternative text to non-text elements using the alt attribute or ARIA labels.
