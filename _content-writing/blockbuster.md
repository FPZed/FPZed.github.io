<p class = "title">A TALE OF TWO VIDEO RENTAL companies</p>
<p class = "subtitle">What Blockbuster's demise TEACHES US ABOUT ADAPTING TO CHANGE</p>
<p class = "byline">By Nick Acre and François Zucco</p>

![Blockbuster and Netflix logos.](/assets/images/content/blockbuster/blockbuster.png)

At its height as leader of the video-rental market in 2004, Blockbuster operated over 9,000 stores and employed over 80,000 people globally. In the wake of subscription-based video and the rise of Netflix, Blockbuster declared bankruptcy in 2010. As of this publication, it survives as one store in Bend, Oregon.

Disruptive innovation can compromise a business, and so can failure to react at an organizational level to disruptive innovation.

To this end, we studied this case to inform businesses on the importance of well-managed change and long-term planning.

# 1985 to 1997: A PLAYING FIELD SET
The first Blockbuster store opened in Dallas, Texas, in 1985. **David Cook**, a businessman in the oil and gas industry, wanted to get into the video market. He grew Blockbuster to become the leader of video rentals in the United States. In 1994, Viacom bought the company for $8.4 billion.

![John Antioco.](/assets/images/content/blockbuster/atioco.png)
<p class = "caption">John Atioco, 2007</p>

<p class = "dropcap"> <b>John Antioco</b> came on as CEO in 1997 and helped grow Blockbuster to its greatest size. He employed a successful revenue sharing model with movie studios and began an initiative that guaranteed that the supply of popular movies would always meet demand. In 2004, Blockbuster reported an annual revenue of $6 billion. </p>

At the same time, Netflix, Blockbuster’s would-be competitor, was slowly expanding with its own subscription based, video-by-rental model. Reed Hastings founded the company in 1997. Three years later, he offered to sell it to Blockbuster for $50 million. This offer was rejected by Antioco on the reasoning that Netflix’s market was too niche and that it was constantly losing money.

There were two other important competitors to Blockbuster: **Redbox** and **Walmart**.

Redbox deployed unmanned kiosks from which customers could rent DVDs. This allows it to be distributed in huge quantities across the United States at minimal cost.
Walmart was a major retailer, quickly growing to take its modern place as the world’s largest business. Among a plethora of other items, these stores sold VHSs and, later, DVDs, making it a major competitor with Blockbuster.

# LATE FEES: AN EXPLOITATIVE BUSINESS MODEL
Blockbuster’s success was undeniable, but its foundations were brittle. Throughout the company’s lifetime, movie rentals formed the majority of Blockbuster’s revenue, and some movies were in greater demand than others. Maximizing profits meant maximizing the number of times a single movie could be rented.

The key bottleneck for this was ironically the customers themselves, who tended to want to hold on to movies at their leisure. A strong incentive was needed to ensure customers returned their movies as quickly as possible. Blockbuster provided this incentive through **late fees**.

<p class = "quote">Both businesses tackled the same problem: one solved it by punishing customers for wanting what they wanted. The other solved it by giving those customers more things to want.</p>

What began as a sound strategy to keep movies coming and going from Blockbusters also turned into a new source of revenue. Late fees could double or even triple the original cost of a rental and soon formed a cornerstone of Blockbuster’s income. In 2000, Blockbuster earned $800 million in late fees – 16% of their revenue that year . Some analysts speculated that at its height, Blockbuster made 70% of their annual revenue from late fees alone.

Late fees looked good on balance sheets and pleased shareholder, but customers were effectively being punished. Pressured to return movies before they might be ready and charge a high price if they failed to do so, customers abided Blockbuster’s model for as long as there were no significant competitors.

![Reed Hastings](/assets/images/content/blockbuster/reed.png)
<p class = "caption">Reed Hastings, 2005</p>

<p class = "dropcap"> <b>Netflix</b> lacked brick-and-mortar stores where customers could browse movies, but it had a payment system that was fundamentally more appealing to consumers. Netflix charged a flat subscription and mailed their movies directly to customers. Customers were allowed to keep several at a time without incurring late fees.</p>

Whereas Blockbuster was constantly vying to get their most popular movies returned so they could rent them again to someone else, Netflix approached the demand for new releases in an innovative way: rather than create a system to penalize late returns, they created one for recommendations of older movies for subscribers based on previous movies they’d rented. This system was so effective, it decreased demand for new releases to 20% of the total demand, as opposed to 70% for conventional video rental services.

Both businesses tackled the same problem: one solved it by punishing customers for wanting what they wanted. The other solved it by giving those customers more things to want.

As well-entrenched a competitor as Blockbuster was, the market steadily showed which business model consumers preferred. Launched in 1998 without announcing a positive fiscal year until 2003, Netflix was proving disruptive even before they launched the streaming service with which their company would become synonymous.

The movie rental subscription service would grow exponentially, from 300,000 subscribers in 2000 to over 7 million in 2007. In that same timeframe, Blockbuster was anything but defeated, but it was rightly concerned by the steady growth of a competitor.

Netflix was on to something, and Blockbuster correctly surmised that it needed to react.

# 2004: Attempted Reforms

In 2004, CEO John Antioco began planning two major initiatives in response to growing threats by competitors.

The prominence of subscription services forced Blockbuster to reassess its late fee policy. To remain competitive, Antioco implemented a “No Late Fees ” program starting January 2005 in select stores. It would never fully adopt the policy. Many stores experienced problems with availability of popular movies. Customers would take out the in-demand DVDs for inordinate lengths of time, creating a shortage and a loss of revenue. By December of that same year, many Blockbuster stores reinstated the fee.

![Still from a No More Late Fees commercial](/assets/images/content/blockbuster/no-late-fees.png)
<p class = "caption">"No More Late Fees" commercial, 2005</p>

The lack of clarity on the new program ultimately led to the company being sued by New Jersey officials for false advertising. Although the late fee had been removed, customers who kept their rented DVD or tape for a week past due were charged for the full sale price of the item, minus the cost of the rental. This cost was charged straight to the customer’s credit card without notification. If the customer returned the item within a month, they could get a full refund, minus a small “restocking” fee – another point of contention by the plaintiffs. Blockbuster eventually settled by offering full refunds to affected customers. This settlement cost the company less than $1 million.

Nevertheless, shareholders calculated that the No Late Fee program lost Blockbuster $200 to $300 million dollars a year in lost profits.

      }
    }
  }
});
</script>

<p class = "caption">Blockbuster’s annual operating costs took a major dip in 2003 - 04 while it fought to stay competitive</p>

Antioco’s second major initiative was Blockbuster Total Access, launched in 2006. Competing directly with Netflix, subscription-paying customers could browse the Blockbuster Online website and have DVDs mailed directly to them. Plus, subscribers would get coupons for a free rental upon returning the DVD to a Blockbuster store.

Total Access operated at a loss but was able to gain over two million subscribers by 2007. Next to Netflix’s 8.3 million subscribers, Total Access was a strong, emerging competitor. The two companies fought a legal battle over patent infringement, eventually settling in June 2007.

Antioco’s reforms might have been seen as necessary to compete, but were inarguably drastic and costly, causing upset in the upper echelons of the company.

# Resistance to Change
While there might have been a will to innovate, Blockbuster’s position of dominance in the market made it inflexible. Technology would eventually enable its competitors to bypass the retail giant.

When Antioco refused Reed Hastings’ offer to sell Netflix for $50 million, the reasoning wasn’t unsound. At that point, Netflix was still only a DVD mailing service. It was a niche company with consistent operating losses and a high attrition rate . In 2000, it had only 300,000 subscribers. But Hastings had a model that appealed to consumers and Netflix quickly rose to success. It turned its first profit of $6.5 million in 2003. By 2006, Netflix counted 6.3 million subscribers, and the numbers continued to soar.

<p class = "caption">Netflix subscriber growth</p>

Blockbuster was slow to adopt DVD  format, which had begun to be sold commercially in 1997. In 1999, 13% of Blockbuster stores were renting out DVDs. They also turned down a deal offered by Warner Bros. to exclusively rent new DVDs before they were sold to the general public, in return for 40% of rental revenues. Blockbuster reasoned that since the studios relied on them for profit, such a deal was unnecessary. Warner Bros. instead priced their DVDs low enough that mass retailers like Walmart could compete. DVD sales became hugely popular, and Walmart soon replaced Blockbuster as the studios’ main source of revenue.

Blockbuster executives explained that they had not expected consumers to adopt the DVD as rapidly as they had. In 2002, DVD sales nearly doubled VHS sales. In 2003, they more than tripled. By 2006, the U.S. market was spending $24 billion on DVD rentals and sales.

Attempts by Blockbuster to offer direct video services were never successful.

In 2000, Blockbuster signed a deal with Enron to use their fiber-optic telecommunications network to provide on-demand service. Their relationship fell through a year later, shortly before Enron went bankrupt.

In 2007, Blockbuster acquired Movielink in a bid to enter the online market, dominated at the time by Netflix. A year later, Movielink was shut down. Netflix had begun its hugely successful streaming service, while Blockbuster refocused on its brick-and-mortar stores.

<p class = "caption">From its 2004 peak, Blockbusters stored shuttered across the U.S. and the world.</p>

The stores  had remained Blockbuster’s primary concentration. Their reputation was that there was a Blockbuster around the corner of every home in the U.S. and Canada. As online and mail services took up an increasingly large portion of the rental market, Blockbuster’s thousands of stores became a disadvantage. The operating cost for the stores ate up a significant portion of revenue, while services like Netflix or Redbox could compete without physical location to maintain and with a fraction of the labour cost.

From its peak in 2004, Blockbuster stores would continually shutter around the world. In America, it went from 5,809 stores to 3,090 when the company closed down.

# Dissonance with Shareholders

In 2004, Blockbuster’s owner, Viacom, granted the rental giant its independent, citing an inability to integrate Blockbuster into its other media assets. John Antioco was now accountable only to a newly expanded host of shareholders who had, at first, little interest in contesting the leadership of the CEO who had brought Blockbuster to the height of its market dominance.

As part of being spun off into its own business, Blockbuster was granted a number of shares in Viacom. John Antioco promptly sold  them off to begin an ambitious program of expansion into new markets and technologies.

But this move also brought a sudden intake of new shareholders.

![Carl Icahn](/assets/images/content/blockbuster/icahn.png)
<p class = "caption">Carl Icahn, 2015</p>

<p class = "dropcap"><b>Carl Icahn</b>, a billionaire activist shareholder, took up the position of leading those shareholders who were skeptical of these new strategies. In 2005, he began an aggressive campaign to join the board of directors.</p>

For Icahn, the changes Antioco was pushing for were too radical. By May of 2005, Icahn was elected director of the board alongside three allied candidates who were elected with 77% of the vote. It was landslide victory for the skeptics and proved that shareholders had little confidence in Antioco.

But Icahn himself had unimaginative solutions to the same problems the CEO was trying to solve. Among Icahn’s criticisms of Antioco were allegedly wasteful initiatives to win customers back and his decision to pull out of an attempt to buy out Blockbuster’s number two competitor in video rental, Hollywood Entertainment (a buyout that would have effectively saddled Blockbuster with more stores facing the same mounting obsolescence).

# Pushback from Within
With growing competition by Netflix and Redbox, Blockbuster attempted reforms but was unable to commit to them. This indecisiveness contributed to the company’s failure.

By 2004, John Antioco understood the threat posed by Netflix and that Blockbuster’s business model was unsustainable. He attempted drastic new changes that would take the company in a more competitive direction. These were the “No Late Fees” program and Blockbuster Total Access.

Antioco estimated a $400 million cost to these initiatives. In 2004, Blockbuster reported a $1.25 billion  dollar loss in operating income, a 149% increase from the previous year. This proved to be too high a price for the board of directors. Led by Carl Icahn, they pushed the reinstatement of late fees and to refocus on brick-and-mortar stores.

<p class = "caption">Blockbuster’s annual revenue during Antioco’s tenure</p>

{:/nomarkdown}

Antioco was forced out in 2007 over the board’s complaints about his decision making and his annual bonus. The board engaged Jim Keyes, former president and CEO of 7-eleven, to replace him.

Key’s new strategy returned brick-and-mortar stores to the centrepiece of Blockbuster’s business. They would revamp the stores by selling beverages, snacks, books and electronic gadgets. They would sell DVDs as well as renting them, competing with outlets such as Walmart. Antioco’s reforms were halted and eventually reversed. Blockbuster Total Access subscription fees were raised, and the service lost half a million subscribers. In 2010, late-fees were reintroduced under the guise of an “additional daily rate,” which was capped at $10, cheaper than the old late fees but still of lesser value than competitors’ monthly subscriptions.

As Keyes and Icahn refocused on the stores, they would publicly dismiss the competition by Netflix and Redbox, right up until Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in September 2010.

# 2010: Bankruptcy

Declaring bankruptcy in 2010 freed Blockbuster from its multi-billion-dollar debt, but the damage was already done. Having lost critical market share, the company would change leadership and owners several more times over the following years. By then, value mostly came from attempts by other companies to use Blockbuster’s iconic branding to compete with Netflix as a streaming service.

Eventually, Blockbuster’s final owners, the Dish Network, found no use in this purpose. They would combine Blockbuster on Demand with the Blockbuster@home TV package into the DISH movie pack.
